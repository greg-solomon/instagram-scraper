Simple scraper for instagram. As of now, it only scrapes links to each post. Working on implementing data scraping for the number of likes, the post's text, and the photo's source.

Scraped data goes into the JSON folder.

USAGE

npm i

node index.js <instagram-user-name> <number of posts to fetch>
